Building Tedium from Source
---------------------------------

Tedium is free, open source software hosted at <https://github.com/dustinrue/Tedium>.  If you wish to build Tedium yourself you can do so by cloning the Tedium code to your computer.  If you don't have git installed you will need to install either the GitHub client for Mac at <http://mac.github.com/> which install a GUI client as well as the command line client or if you simply want the command line client installed you can get it from <http://git-scm.com/download>.  If you need additional help with using Git GitHub is a great resource.  You will find GitHub's documentation at <http://help.github.com/>.


Once cloned, open the project file in Xcode and issue command+b to build the app or command+r to build and run it.
